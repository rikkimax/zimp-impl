Reflection on the project
=========================
The quality of the project is rather simplistic and no where near playable.
This was because of incomplete tile class. However more could have been done
to make the cli interface to be more complete. Because of all these factors
this project for me was not close to adequate quality in terms of my own
judgement. But based upon time of all members who contributed it means it was
not possible to do a more adequate job. Atleast on my end.
